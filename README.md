> Refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow `.github/workflows editorconfig.yml` without `workflow` scope

Sometimes we get errors like this when pushing to samuela/nixpkgs, because samuela/nixpkgs is behind the upstream fork. When the fork is missing changes to sensitive files like `.github/...` stuff the push is rejected.

Fix is to manually pull from upstream and push to the fork to get things up-to-date.
